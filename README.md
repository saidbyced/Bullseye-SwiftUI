# Bullseye
This is a simple game created using the SwiftUI framework. For an example of the game created using UIKit, please see my repository 'Bullseye-UIKit'.

## How to use this respository
Ensure you have a Apple computer with XCode version 11.1 or later installed.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the app in XCode and build and run the app.

## Notes
This app was created using the tutorial available at raywenderlich.com but has some ammendments to ensure layout is still satisfactory on older devices.
